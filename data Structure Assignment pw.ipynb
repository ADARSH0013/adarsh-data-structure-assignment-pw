    "#FIRST QUESTION---  Discuss string slicing and provide example. \n",
    "\n",
    "#  String slicing in Python is a way to get specific parts of a string by using start, end, and step values.\n",
    "#  It’s especially useful for text manipulation and data parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#EXAMPLE----      \n",
    "s = \"Hello, Python!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Slice string from index 0 to index 5 (exclusive)\n",
    "s2 = s[0:5]\n",

    "#SECOND QUESTION---  Explain the key features of lists in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "#   You can use Python lists to store data of multiple types simultaneously.\n",
    "#   Lists help preserve data sequences and further process those sequences in other ways.\n",
    "#   Lists are dynamic.\n",
    "#   Lists are mutable.\n",
    "#   Lists are ordered.\n",
    "#   An index is used to traverse a list.\n",

    "\n",
    "#    to add elements to a list, we can use append() method-----\n",
    "\n",
    "#     The append() method in Python adds a single element to the end of a list. This method is especially useful \n",
    "#          when you need to dynamically build a list by adding new elements one at a time\n",

    "# , such as insertion and deletion.\n",

    "#  Lists consume more memory                   ||    Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Lists have several built-in methods          ||    Tuple does not have many built-in methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# FIFTH QUESTION---   Describe the key features of sets and provide examples of their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.\n",
    "#   Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, \n",
    "#   Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.\n",
    "#   Sets are written with curly brackets.\n",

    "\n",
    "#   Tuple------ Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list. The sequence of values stored in a tuple \n",
    "#   can be of any type, and they are indexed by integers. Values of a tuple are syntactically separated by ‘commas’. \n",
    "#   Although it is not necessary, it is more common to define a tuple by closing the sequence of values in parentheses\n",
